                           <p>You were planned. The God of heaven has ascribed value to every person on the planet.  Think of it, every cell in your body is unique to you.  No one has your DNA.  Your retna, fingerprint, and your voice have all been used to prove your unique identity. With a hair from your head, scientists can tell if you are left-handed, or not.  They can tell how tall you will be when fully grown, the color of your eyes, skin, and the list goes on.  There are no two of us that are identical.  With the birth of each baby on the planet, there is a unique identifier that sets him or her apart from all the others.  God tells us in His word that He was the artist that formed Adam from the dust of the ground, and sculpted Eve. Psalm 139 tells us that He formed us in our mother's womb.  He saw our substance not yet being formed.  He told told Jeremiah that He formed him with a purpose.  His Word affirms that each of us were hand-crafted by the fingers of the Almighty with value from the womb.  We will have value until we reach the tomb; from pampers to depends we all have value because God loves and values us.</p>

                           <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">God has revealed Himself to us through His Word, the Bible.</span>  Every religion has a source of authority, a document or a figure where they learn from and about the god they serve.  Some use the Bible as one of many, but other sources of authority seem to rise to the top.  For us, the ultimate authority is God's Word, the Bible, which has stood the test of time.  Several have tried to destroy it, discredit it and even alter it.  God has preserved His Word, and we believe the 66 books found in the Old and New Testaments have all the teachings that we need for life and godliness.  The Bible is all we need to learn about, hear from and follow God.  </p>

                           </a>
                           <p> From the first stories in Genesis, to the final chapter of The Revelation, God has revealed a separation between Himself and humanity.  When Adam, the first human broke God's law, Adam sold the entire race to live under the bondage of sin, or disobedience to His ways and His law.  This sin nature is passed from a father to all his children, <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+5%3A+12&version=ESV">see Romans 5:12.</a> Some choose to live their life as if God were not there.  
                              <br><br>
                              God, Himself was the first missionary.  He wants restoration.  He has made a way for us to be restored to Him.  God told Adam that the day that he eats the fruit from the tree knowledge of good and evil, Adam would surely die. Read it for yourself <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+2%3A17&version=ESV">here.</a>  That day, Adam's unique relationship with the God who had created him died; forever changed by his one act of disobedience.  They could no longer walk together as they had previously.  Adam and Eve lost paradise, and for the first time ever, shame and guilt plagued the human race.  As a result, God cursed the ground, and made Adam work hard for his food. He increased the pain in childbirth for the ladies. Then, in an act of mercy, God took a lamb, killed it, and made clothes for the couple to cover their nakedness.  There was a direct connection between the lamb that was killed, and the act of disobedience.  The lamb died because they disobeyed.  
                           <h3>The Bible is divided into two parts,</h3>
                           The first being the Old Testament, or Covenant, covering the time between creation and around four hundred years before Jesus' birth.  The second is the New Testament, or Covenant covering the time from Jesus' birth to the prophesies of the end of time as we know it.  
                           Both the Old an New Testament show that God is on a rescue mission to find people who are far from Him and bring them near.  He is personally involved in this quest to save humanity from their sins.  He has given us a history lesson and told us where we came from, how the first man, Adam and his wife disobeyed His only rule.  He has shared with us through His Word how He provided for them, and for us.</p>
                           <h3>
                           The Old testament not only gives us a history lesson of where we came from, and how sin entered the world,</h6> 
                           <p>but also contains God's law, the sacrificial system, and prophesies that tell of one who would come and save them from their sins.
                              God spoke to one man, Abram who would followed Him.  God promised Abram lots of descendants.  He fullfilled that promise in the first couple books of the Bible.  They became a great nation, that turned their back on God.  They began to fight among themselves, and split up into two, the Northern Kingdom, and Judah.  God sent prophets, but the people continued to rebel against Him.  His prophets urged the  people to turn back to God, they didn't.  God destroyed the Northern Kingdom.  He sent Judah into captivity in Babalynon for a period of 70 years.  The temple was burned with fire, the city walls were destroyed and the young men were either carried away to Babalyon or killed.  The Old Testament also records the return of the Jewish people to Jerusalem, the rebuilding of the wall and the temple.  The book of Psalms is actually a collection of songs and poems that were recorded throughout the time of the Old Testament.  Proverbs and Job share wisdom literature with the reader.  The end of the time that the Old Testament was written, the Jewish people were left with the laws, the sacrificial system, history, songs, wisdom and most importantly over 600 prophesies that told of a coming messiah or savior that would deliver them.  Then there were four hundred years of silence from God.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                           <h6>When the time was right,</h6>
                           and Zechariah had served as a priest for a number of years. When it was His turn to hold a special service, God spoke to him and said that his wife would have a son.  Although his barren wife was old, she would give birth to a baby boy, and that he should call his name John.  This pregnancy was the spark of a new era.  Zechariah's wife was related to a young virgin girl named Mary.  This is the same Mary that would give birth to Jesus.  The first four books of the New Testament are eye-witness accounts of His life, ministry, death, and resurrection of Jesus. The book of Acts is a history book, and the rest are letters that explain, encourage and give direction to the church.  Each of these letters were written for a different purpose, by different authors and specific recipients in mind.</p>

                           <h3>The Book of Romans</h3>
                           was written by a lawyer with the express purpose of giving us directions to heaven.  According to the first three chapters, Paul argues that we are sinners.  That the result of sin is death, as described in the Old Testament.  We are sinners by choice, and by nature.  We cannot save ourselves.  God demonstrated His love for us by dying on the cross for our sins.  The price tag for sin is death.  Jesus died in our place, paying our sin debt.  Three days later He rose from the dead, as had been prophesied in the Old Testament.  The Bible is clear, that if we confess that Jesus is Lord, believe that God raised Him from the dead, and transfer ownership of our life to Him, we will be saved.  This is His promise.  We cannot earn favor with God any other way.</p>
                           <div class="">

                                 <h2 class="blog-head" style="color: #2d2d2d;">Jesus is God</h2>
                              </a>
                              <h3>The Bible tells us in John 10:24-33</h3>
                              that Jesus is God. Jesus claimed to be God, His enemies, the Jews, were ready to kill him and announced that because He,they said, being a man, made Himself equal to God. See also Colossians 2:8-9.  There are other references to His diety.  His mother was a virgin at his birth.  Her husband Joseph and she had other children after Jesus' birth.  Jesus lived a perfect life.  Jesus was 100% God, and 100% man. 
                              <h6>Jesus welcomed sinners.</h6>
                              He spoke with a woman at a well, stood at the defense of a woman caught in the act of adultry.  Funny, she was alone committing adultry, but the Jews wanted to stone her for Adultry.He had dinner with a tax collector, who was despised by the religious elite.  Jesus was a missionary.  He came to show God's love to the world around Him.He made a way to God for us.  He is the mediator, or the only one who connects us to God. Before He returned to Heaven, He left us an example and gave us a command to show God's love to the world, and to each other.</p>
                              <p>
                              <h3>The Holy Spirit</h3>
                              is the silent member of the trinity. His role is to convince those who are not believers that they are sinners, they need Him because He is right, and one day they will be judged for the wrong that they have done.  Every believer was sealed with the Spirit when they put their transferred ownership of their life to Jesus.  He is the guarantee that we will make it into Heaven.  His role is to fit us for Heaven, give us direction, and fill our life with peace.  As mentioned before, the book of Romans is the key that unlocks heaven's door.  The book of 1 John, which is in the back of the Bible, is the book that gives us an assurance that we are His.</p>
                              <h3>Jesus came to seek and save that which was lost.</h3>
                              </a>
                              <p>
                              <h3>The Church is</h3>
                              a group of baptized believers that meet regularly for discipleship, worship and prayer.  Every believer should want to be in church, which is a safe place where they can grow in their faith and have communion with others who are like-minded.
                              <h3>At the Care center</h3>
                              We are one of the arms that supporting local Churches in the Cookeville area use to reach out to the community with Jesus' love.  We serve those who need counseling, food, clothing and connect them with other resources where they can get help that they need from people of faith.</p>

                                 3 There is no speech nor language
                                 Where their voice is not heard.
